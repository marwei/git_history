# Marwei's Github Calendar Make Up

First of all, please allow me to say thank you. It means a lot to me that you have dig into my github history this far.

This repo is not a scam. It's just a way to get your attention. Afterall, nothing says worse about a code farmer than a blank github calendar. 

This past year I've been doing a lot of development work for [102 Lab](http://102lab.com/), a technology consulting company I cofounded. All of the projects are under confidientiality agreement with my clients. My development team and I collaborated mainly over a private git server. Some of the code that are actually on github are all kept private, hence the blank public activity. If you look at my side of the screen, you will see my github calendar actually looks like this:

I'm gradually extracting open-sourceable parts from my past projects. But while I'm moving the mountains, why don't we get acquainted first? You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinzhuwei), or simply  email me at [yo@weiz.hu](mailto:yo@weiz.hu).
